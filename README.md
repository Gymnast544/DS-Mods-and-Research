# DS-Mods-and-Research

This is a backup of my Notion pages. Earlier on I spent a lot of time researching old capture cards, as well as did some simple mods for DSes. Also some notes on reverse engineering portions of the DS and DSi. Lastly there's firmware for an old DSi capture card I found on the internet archive.


Most of these are PDF exports of pages that I wrote on Notion, so formatting might not be great.
